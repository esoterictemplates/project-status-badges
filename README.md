## Project Status

This system defines $4$ distinct states at which a project can be:

* [Maintained][maintained]
* [Finished][finished]
* [Unfinished][unfinished]
* [Abandoned][abandoned]

These statuses can be organised and described by the following table:

| $\downarrow$ [Stable version](#stable-versions)? \ [WIP](#work-in-progress-projects)? $\rightarrow$ | Yes                                               | No                                              |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Yes                                                                                                 | ![Project Status Badge: 'Maintained'][maintained] | ![Project Status Badge: 'Finished'][finished]   |
| No                                                                                                  | ![Project Status Badge: 'Unfinished'][unfinished] | ![Project Status Badge: 'Abandoned'][abandoned] |

### Stable Versions

A stable version of a project is defined as a version or revision of the project that you would consider complete - it should contain all of the features that were originally planned for the project. It should not contain any known bugs (ideally, it shouldn't contain any bugs or issues).

### Work in Progress Projects

A project is work in progress if you may still update it in the future or you are actively developing it right now.

### Maintained

![Project Status Badge: 'Maintained'][maintained]

### Finished

![Project Status Badge: 'Finished'][finished]

### Unfinished

![Project Status Badge: 'Unfinished'][unfinished]

### Abandoned

![Project Status Badge: 'Abandoned'][abandoned]
