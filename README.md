# Project Status Badges

<sup>By [Esoteric Enderman][author]</sup>

[![Project Status Badge: 'Unfinished'][status]](#unfinished)

Badges for quickly and easily indicating the [status](#project-status) of a project.

Project Status Badges are a collection of [4 unique status badges][badges] that you can use to indicate the [development status](#project-status) of your project. For example, you can put them in your project's README.md file.

The badges were derived from [Shields.io Badges][shields], a [CC0][shields-license-statement] project which provides badges as a service. This means that the [project status badges][badges] will be visually compatible with the [Shields.io Badges][shields] - so you can use both in your project's README.md file.

## Project Status

This system defines **4 distinct states** at which a project can be:

* [Maintained][maintained]
* [Finished][finished]
* [Unfinished][unfinished]
* [Abandoned][abandoned]

These statuses can be organised and described by the following table:

| v [Stable version](#stable-versions)? \ [WIP](#work-in-progress-projects)? > | Yes                                               | No                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Yes                                                                          | ![Project Status Badge: 'Maintained'][maintained] | ![Project Status Badge: 'Finished'][finished]   |
| No                                                                           | ![Project Status Badge: 'Unfinished'][unfinished] | ![Project Status Badge: 'Abandoned'][abandoned] |

### Stable Versions

A **stable version** of a project is defined as a version or revision of the project that you would consider *complete* - it should:

* contain all of the features that were originally planned for the project; and
* not contain any known bugs (ideally, it shouldn't contain any bugs or issues).

### Work in Progress Projects

A project is **work in progress** if:

* it may still be updated in the future; or
* it is actively being developed right now.

### Maintained

![Project Status Badge: 'Maintained'][maintained]

**Maintained** projects are mature, have at least one [stable version](#stable-versions) and are still being *developed*, or they are simply being *kept up-to-date*. This is the 'ideal' state for a project.

### Finished

![Project Status Badge: 'Finished'][finished]

**Finished** projects are self-explanatory: the project has been marked as *complete* and won't be worked on anymore. This is the best-case scenario for projects you don't want to work on anymore.

### Unfinished

![Project Status Badge: 'Unfinished'][unfinished]

**Unfinished** projects are still in a *work-in-progress* state and may not have all of their intended features implemented. There may be bugs or issues.

### Abandoned

![Project Status Badge: 'Abandoned'][abandoned]

**Abandoned** projects are those which do not have a stable (complete) version and which the author(s) decided are not worth working on anymore.
