## Project Status

This system defines $4$ distinct states at which a project can be:

* [Maintained][maintained]
* [Finished][finished]
* [Unfinished][unfinished]
* [Abandoned][abandoned]

These statuses can be organised and described by the following table:

| Is there a stable version of the project? \ Will you keep working on the project?                | Yes                                               | No                                              |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Yes                                                                                              | ![Project Status Badge: 'Maintained'][maintained] | ![Project Status Badge: 'Finished'][finished]   |
| No                                                                                               | ![Project Status Badge: 'Unfinished'][unfinished] | ![Project Status Badge: 'Abandoned'][abandoned] |
